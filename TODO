If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:

    * Documentation (this is actually starting to get critical)
    * Once set, callbacks cannot be subsequently disabled for a given handle
    * A high-level interface to pycurl, like the standard urllib (see
      the file 'tests/curl.py' for a simple example)
    * We currently require Python to be built with thread support, this
      requirement could perhaps be relaxed?
