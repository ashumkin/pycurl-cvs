If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:


NEW FEATURES:

    * The current curl HLI only works on Python 2.2 or better. Either
      fix this, or change the docs and setup.py accordingly.

    * Add docs to the high-level interface.

    * Add more options to the undocumented and currently mostly useless
      Curl.unsetopt() method. Have to carefully check the libcurl source
      code for each option we want to support.

    * Support more of the CURLFORM_* API in HTTPPOST.
