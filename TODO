If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:


NEW FEATURES:

    * HTTPPOST should take a dict instead of a list of tuples, this way it
      would have the same interface as POSTFIELDS.

    * Support more of the CURLFORM_* API in HTTPPOST.

    * Add docs to the high-level interface.

    * Add more options to the undocumented and currently mostly useless
      Curl.unsetopt() method. Have to carefully check the libcurl source
      code for each option we want to support.
