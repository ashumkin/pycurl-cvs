If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:

    * Use curl_formadd() instead of the deprecated curl_formparse().

    * Add support for new libcurl 7.10.7 features.

    * Add support for CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION and CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA
      (can we do this without having to wrap the ssl-context structure?).

    * The current curl HLI only works on Python 2.2 or better. Either
      fix this, or change the docs and setup.py accordingly.

    * Add docs to the high-level interface.

    * Add more options to the undocumented and currently mostly useless
      Curl.unsetopt() method. Have to carefully check the libcurl source
      code for each option we want to support.
