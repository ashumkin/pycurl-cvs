If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:

    * Support curl_multi_info_read (need to hack libcurl here too)
    * Documentation (finish the stuff in the doc/ directory)
    * A high-level interface to pycurl, like the standard urllib (see
      the file 'doc/examples/curl.py' for a simple example)
