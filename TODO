If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:

    * I think CURLOPT_FILETIME needs to be checked (check test_getinfo.py
      for the current namespace prefix hack used -- kjetilja)

    * A nicer mechanism to decrease the reference count on container
      objects and classes passed as options to setopt (this has to be
      hacked in ugly ways now)

    * A high-level interface to pycurl, like the standard urllib (see
      the file 'doc/examples/curl.py' for a simple example)
