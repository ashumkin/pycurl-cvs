If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:


BUGS:

    * Find the GC tracking bug which cause Python to fail an assertion.


DEPRECATED LIBCURL FEATURES:

    * Use curl_formadd() instead of the deprecated curl_formparse().

    * PASSWDFUNCTION/PASSWDDAT/curl_passwd_callback are not used
      since 7.10.8 and will be removed in a future release.


ADD NEW LIBCURL FEATURES:

    * Add support for missing libcurl 7.10.6 features:

      - Add support for CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION and CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA
        (can we do this without having to wrap the ssl-context structure?).

    * Add support for missing libcurl 7.10.8 features [MOSTLY DONE]:

      - CURL_HTTP_VERSION_* constants [FIXME - name clash]


NEW FEATURES:

    * The current curl HLI only works on Python 2.2 or better. Either
      fix this, or change the docs and setup.py accordingly.

    * Add docs to the high-level interface.

    * Add more options to the undocumented and currently mostly useless
      Curl.unsetopt() method. Have to carefully check the libcurl source
      code for each option we want to support.
