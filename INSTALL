You need Python and libcurl installed on your system to use or build pycurl.

Disutils
--------

Assuming that distutils is installed (which it is by default on Python
versions greater than 1.5.2) build and install pycurl with the
following commands:

        (if necessary, become root)
        tar -zxvf pycurl-$VER.tar.gz
        cd pycurl-$VER
        python setup.py install

$VER should be substituted with the version number, e.g. 7.9.7.

Note that the installation script assumes that 'curl-config' can be
located in your path setting.  If curl-config is installed outside your path
or you want to force installation to use a particular version of 
curl-config, use the '--curl-config' commandline option to specify
the location of curl-config.  Example:

        python setup.py install --curl-config=/usr/local/bin/curl-config

To build pycurl for Python 1.5.2 you also need the distutils package,
which you can download from:

        http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html

... or be brave and manually tweak the Makefile in the 'src'
directory to match your installation (the Makefile should work
fine for RedHat distros with Python 1.5.2).


Windows
-------

When installing on Windows, you need to manually configure the path to
the curl source tree, specified with the CURL_DIR variable in the file
'setup.py'.  The CURL_DIR variable can also be set using the commandline
option '--curl-dir':

        python setup.py install --curl-dir=c:\curl-7.9.8
