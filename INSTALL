You need Python and libcurl (version 7.9.6 or greater) installed on your
system to use or build pycurl.


Disutils
--------

To build pycurl for Python 1.5.X you also need the distutils package,
which you can download from:

	http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html

Assuming that distutils is installed (which it is by default on Python
versions above 1.5.2) build and install pycurl with the following
commands:

	(if necessary, become root)
	tar -zxvf pycurl-$VER.tar.gz
	cd pycurl-$VER
	python setup.py install

$VER should be substituted with the version number, e.g. 0.3.0.


Windows
-------

When installing on Windows, you need to manually configure three path
settings in setup.py defined by the following variables:

	W32_INCLUDE	- Path to the libcurl 'include' directory
	W32_LIB		- Path to the libcurl 'lib' directory
	W32_EXTRA_OBJ	- Path to libcurl library file itself

Then run 'python setup.py install' as usual.  Note that you currently
need Visual C/C++ installed to build pycurl.  If someone can provide
the necessary modifications (if any) to setup.py to build with other
compilers (e.g. Cygwin or Borland/Inprise) I'd be happy to include
that.
